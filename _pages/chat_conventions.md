title: Chat Channel Conventions
sitename: Pathfinder

Below are the chat channels we manage and the intended use/etiquette around each.

As much as possible, we are encouraging a community/peer-to-peer support model where community members are expected to participate by sharing their experience and advice, and responding to problems and questions as they are able.  While the platform team will attempt to triage, and moderate discussions, the success and sustainability of the model depends to a large degree on participation from the broder community.

Note: Our current chat space is on Slack at https://devopspathfinder.slack.com/ but we likely to be a different platofrm before long.  We will likely retain the same channels and conventions.

#\#sos

\#sos is where you should post when you have one of the issues below:

 * a production problem with an OpenShift-hosted app that you can't solve without external assistance from the DevOps platform team or ESIT.
 * an issue with an OpenShift hosted project support tool that has caused a work stoppage that cannot be worked around

Note that normal BC Gov support channels (77000, IMB help desks, etc.) should be used for shared infrastructure such as reverse proxies, SiteMinder, firewall rules, etc.

This channel will be monitored by the platform team and ESIT during business hours.     

#\#how-to

\#how-to is for asking *non-urgent* questions about approaches to solving problems, evaluating technical options, getting feedback on different approaches, familiarity with platform features or tools, resources/examples, etc. 

#\#operations

\#operations is primarily for communications between the platform team, ESIT, and RedHat.  On occasion, conversation with community members may get pulled into this channel (e.g. from #sos) for troubleshooting, etc. but in general community members should not need to post in #operations.

#\#requests

\#requests is for the platform team to receive access requests such as:
 
 * adding users to the BCGov GitHub organization, who may be collaborating on BC Gov open source projects hosted on GitHub. 
 * adding users to the BCDevOps GitHub organization (which governs access to OpenShift)
  
Access requests should ideally be submitted by a BC Gov staff member with one of the following roles: team admin, lead, scrum master, or product owner, although we recognize that may not always be practical.

Please include the following in access requests:

* requested GitHub organization
* new user's role on the team/project
* new user's full name 
* new user's GitHub ID
* new user's email address

Note that role based access to specific projects within OpenShift is to be managed by the team admin/owner, not the platform team. 

#\#general 

Whatever.

#\#random 

Jokes (SFW only pls), links, and ~~Cat~~ pug pictures. 'Nuff said.
